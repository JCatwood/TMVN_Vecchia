Description: Under a different representation of the multivariate normal (MVN) probability, we can use the Vecchia approximation to sample the integrand at a linear complexity with respect to n. Additionally, both the SOV algorithm from Genz (92) and the exponential-tilting method from Botev (2017) can be adapted to linear complexity. However, this technique is only applicable to spatial covariance matrices.
